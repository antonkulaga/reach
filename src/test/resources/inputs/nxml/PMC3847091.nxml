Although p53 is mutated in more than 50% of tumours, its mutation rate varies significantly between different types of human cancer, with a particularly high incidence in colorectal and pancreatic tumours. Interestingly, the mediator of signal transduction <italic>RAS</italic> is also commonly mutated in these particular tumour types. It remains unclear why there exists such a tight association between the <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic> mutation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We reported recently that apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (ASPP) 2 co-operates with oncogenic RAS to enhance the transcription and apoptotic function of p53 in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This may be achieved via the ability of active RAS to induce ASPP2, thereby promoting ASPP2&#x02019;s interaction with p53 and enhancing the activity of p53. However, the detailed mechanism underlying this observation remains to be elucidated. </p><p> Activated RAS promotes the protein kinase activity of RAF, which phosphorylates and activates MEK (also known as MAPKK). MEK phosphorylates and activates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), a serine/threonine-selective protein kinase. The MAPK enzymes require a specific phosphorylation sequence where a serine or threonine is followed by proline (S/TP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It was shown that endogenous RAS is necessary for the full apoptotic activity of ASPP2, which suggests that RAS signalling may modify ASPP2, potentially via a phosphorylation event. Phosphorylation by RAS/MAPK modulates the activation of most of their substrates and in some cases the phosphorylation mediates changes in subcellular localisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>ASPP2 belongs to an evolutionarily conserved ASPP family of proteins, alongside ASPP1 and iASPP. All three contain signature sequences in their C-termini; ankyrin repeats, SH3 domain and proline rich sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ASPP2 binds to RAS through its N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The functions of ASPP2 are potentially controlled by its binding partners and localisation. When ASPP2 locates at the cell-cell junctions, it binds and co-localises with PAR3 via its N-terminus to maintain the integrity of cell polarity and adherence junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], whereas in the cytosol/nucleus, ASPP2 enhances p53-induced apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It also binds ATG5 and inhibits RAS-induced autophagy, independently of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus it is important to find the molecular event that controls the localisation of ASPP2. </p><p> Here we show that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of RAS/MAPK. Phosphorylation of ASPP2 by MAPK is required for the RAS-induced translocation of ASPP2, which results in the increased binding to p53. Consequently, the pro-apoptotic activity of ASPP2 is increased by the RAS/Raf/MAPK signalling cascade as ASPP2 phosphorylation mutant fails to do so. Thus phosphorylation of ASPP2 by RAS/MAPK pathway provides a novel link between RAS and p53 in regulating apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>ASPP2 is a novel substrate of MAPK</title><p> It has recently been shown that oncogenic RAS can enhance the apoptotic function of p53 via ASPP1 and ASPP2. Mechanistically ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind RAS-GTP and potentiates RAS signalling to enhance p53 mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. As RAS is upstream of several signalling cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we queried whether the activity of ASPP2 is regulated by the activation of a RAS-mediated signalling pathway. One of the most studied downstream pathways of RAS signalling is the Raf-MAPK pathway. Interestingly, we observed two conserved putative MAPK phosphorylation sites in ASPP1 and ASPP2. The ASPP1 sites are at residues 671 and 746, and the ASPP2 sites are at residues 698 and 827 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We thus tested whether RAS activation may regulate ASPP2 phosphorylation. An <italic>in vitro</italic> phophorylation assay was performed with a purified C-terminus fragment of ASPP2 (693-1128) containing both MAPK putative phosphorylation sites. When compared to p38 SAPK, MAPK1 was clearly able to phosphorylate the ASPP2 fragment <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, left and middle panels). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s001">Figure S1</xref>, histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated <sup>32</sup>P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated <sup>32</sup>P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylated ASPP2 fragment by MAPK1 was digested by trypsin and fractioned on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Each eluted fraction was measured for its radioactivity content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). The fractions representing these radioactive peaks were analysed by mass spectrometry. Of the two radioactive peaks, one represented the linker region between the GST and our ASPP2 fragment and the other corresponded to a fragment of the same mass as that containing the second putative phosphorylation site, serine 827. Hence ASPP2 can be phosphorylated at serine 827 by MAPK1 <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><fig id="pone-0082022-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082022.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>MAPK phosphorylates ASPP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ASPP1 and ASPP2 have two conserved putative MAPK2 phosphorylation sites in their C-terminus.

A polyclonal antibody NGH.S4 was purified by affinity column purification. To test the efficacy of the purified phospho-specific antibody, a non-radioactive <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphorylation assay was performed on the purified GST-ASPP2 fragment (693-1128) with recombinant MAPK1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows that the phospho-specific antibody is specific for the ASPP2 fragment phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by MAPK. To test whether endogenous ASPP2 could be phosphorylated in cells, Saos2 cells were grown in low serum for 50 hours to remove all background stimulation of RAS, after which the cells were stimulated with EGF and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). Phosphorylated endogenous ASPP2 was detected by the phospho-specific antibody 30 minutes after RAS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). ASPP2 phosphorylation was rapid and transient as 3 hours after EGF stimulation phosphorylated ASPP2 was barely detectable. Moreover, with another different phospho-ASPP2 antibody, ES1, ASPP2 phosphorylation was also observed in a human colon cancer cell line HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells, in which RAS activation is induced upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The phospho-specific antibody for ASPP2 is specific as knockdown of ASPP2 resulted in a lack of detection of phospho-ASPP2. All these demonstrate that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of MAPK and Ser827 of ASPP2 can be phosphorylated by RAS/MAPK pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2.2"><title>Raf/MAPK Pathway Activates the Pro-Apoptotic Function of ASPP2</title><p> One of the most studied downstream pathways of RAS signalling is the Raf/MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Knowing ASPP2 is a substrate of MAPK, we thus tested whether activation of Raf/MAPK pathway is sufficient to regulate ASPP2 activity using a mutant form of Raf (Raf CAAX), which is constitutively present at the plasma membrane, so the Raf pathway is constitutively active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The impact of co-expression of Raf CAAX with p53 and ASPP2 was tested by analysing the transcriptional activity of p53 on the pro-apoptotic Bax reporter. Raf CAAX increases Bax-luciferase levels by 2.5 fold over the baseline of p53 and ASPP2 alone (<italic>P</italic>=0.05). This effect is likely to be mediated by ASPP2 as Raf CAAX had little effect on p53 in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0082022-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082022.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Activated Raf enhances the transactivation activity of ASPP2 and p53 to the same extent as activated RAS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Saos2 cells were transfected as indicated with a Bax-luciferase reporter and the luciferase activity shown. * <italic>P</italic>=0.05 (<bold>B</bold>) The value of ASPP2+p53 was taken as 1.0 to reflect the fold increase of ASPP2 and p53 in the presence of activated Raf and mutant RAS. ** <italic>P</italic>=0.0055; **** <italic>P</italic>=0.0001.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0082022.g002"/></fig><p> The effect of Raf CAAX on ASPP2 and p53 was compared to that of HRAS V12 or KRAS V12.

Inhibiting MAPK resulted in a significant decrease in the ability of ASPP2 to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 compared to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), further validating the functional role of ASPP2 phosphorylation by MAPK. Moreover, another MAPK inhibitor, PD 98059, also inhibited ASPP2 function to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Interestingly, the endogenous ASPP2 protein level was slightly decreased following RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition by UO126 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel) while RAS/MAPK pathway activation resulted in the increased ASPP2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g001">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). The mRNA level of ASPP2 was not affected upon RAS/MAPK pathway activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that the regulation is not at the transcriptional level. Thus we investigated whether RAS/MAPK pathway activation could result in the increased protein stability of ASPP2. The ASPP2 protein levels in the presence or absence of oncogenic RAS were measured after cycloheximide (CHX) addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s003">Figure S3B and C</xref>). ASPP2 was a bit more stable when oncogenic RAS is induced in HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s003">Figure S3B</xref>) or co-transfected in Saos2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0082022.s003">Figure S3C</xref>): ASPP2 levels were considerably decreased without oncogenic RAS, while in the presence of HRAS V12, ASPP2 protein levels remained high after CHX treatment. These data indicate that ASPP2 phosphorylation by RAS/MAPK is necessary for ASPP2 full pro-apoptotic activity and this may be mediated by the stabilization of ASPP2 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Ser827 phosphorylation is required for RAS-induced translocation of ASPP2</title><p> It has recently been shown that activation of RAS results in ASPP2 translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We therefore tested whether MAPK phosphorylation at Ser827 could affect the cellular localization of ASPP2.

These findings established ASPP2 as a tumor suppressor and an activator of p53 family. ASPP2 is involved in both senescence in fibroblasts and apoptosis in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. ASPP2 acts at several steps in promoting senescence in fibroblasts. It can do so in a RAS-dependent, p53-independent manner, through its ability to bind ATG5 and to inhibit RAS-induced autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Additionally, it can bind active RAS directly leading to enhanced activation of c-Raf/MAPK-mediated senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p> We and others have recently shown that ASPP2 can potentiate RAS signaling by binding directly via the ASPP2 N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, the RAS-ASPP interaction enhances the transcription function of p53 in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Until now, it has been unclear how RAS could affect ASPP2 to enhance p53 function. We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53, providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0082022-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Additionally, RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway activation stabilizes ASPP2 protein, although the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated.</p><fig id="pone-0082022-g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0082022.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Diagram summarizes the inter-regulation between ASPP2 and RAS.</title><p>ASPP2 binds active RAS at the plasma membrane, thereby increasing RAS signaling to its downstream pathway effectors Raf/MAPK.

It is likely that this possible feedback loop leads to an amplified pro-apoptotic signal. In a scenario where RAS is mutated and thereby constitutively active, it binds ASPP2, resulting in increased RAS/MAPK signaling. This in turn activates ASPP2 via MAPK phosphorylation which will translocate and activate p53 to promote apoptosis. ASPP2 will also continue to bind active RAS, thereby propagating the pro-apoptotic signal from RAS to p53. If RAS is only temporarily active, as happens in natural growth conditions, one could hypothesize that ASPP2 would bind active RAS, potentiate its downstream pathways, and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of ASPP2 would lead to increased binding to p53. However, once RAS reverts to its inactive state, it would be unable to bind to ASPP2 and would therefore be unable to amplify the RAS signal to p53. Only in conditions where RAS is constitutively active would the ASPP2 feedback loop reach a threshold of signaling high enough to result in p53-dependent apoptosis. The ability of oncogenic RAS to stimulate apoptosis allows the cell to have a fail-proof mechanism: mutated RAS signals to p53 via ASPP2 to induce apoptosis instead of uncontrolled proliferation. However, under normal conditions, growth factors or growth receptors would only activate RAS for short periods of time, preventing the amplification of ASPP2 signaling to p53 via the feedback loop, thereby eliminating the apoptotic stimulus. The novel RAS/Raf/MAPK/ASPP2 pathway is thus involved in an important feedback loop between RAS and p53, and is an effective way for mutant RAS to induce apoptosis in cancer cells with wild-type p53. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Cell culture, plasmids and siRNA</title><p> Saos2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

HRASV12 and KRASV12 were tagged with the haemagglutinin (HA) epitope. All expression plasmids used in this study were driven by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, with the exception of the RAS and Raf CAAX plasmids which were driven by the EF1a promoter. The ASPP2 mutants were constructed using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). </p><p> siRNA oligos against ASPP2 were purchased from Dharmacon. Sequences are available from Dharmacon or upon request. We used siGENOME RISC-Free siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, United States) as a negative control.

An affinity column was made by cross-linking the phospho-peptide to epoxy-sepharose-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Serum from the final bleed was clarified by centrifugation and filtration through a 0.45&#x003bc;m filter and was supplemented with 1X TTBS (0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.1% Tween-20).

Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer 16 to 24 hours after transfection and assayed using the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The fold increase of p53 and ASPP by HRASV12/KRASV12/Raf CAAX was determined by the activity of p53 and ASPP in combination with RASV12/Raf CAAX divided by the activity of p53 and ASPP alone. </p></sec><sec id="s4.4"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p> For Western blotting, cells were lysed in either NP40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA), RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0]), Urea solution (8 M Urea, 1 M Thiourea, 0.5% CHAPS, 50 mM DTT, and 24 mM Spermine) or luciferase lysis buffer.
