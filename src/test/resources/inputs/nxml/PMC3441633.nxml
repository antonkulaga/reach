      <abstract>
        <p>The intersectin 1 (ITSN1) scaffold stimulates Ras activation on endocytic vesicles without activating classic Ras effectors. The identification of Class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase beta, PI3KC2&#x3B2;, as an ITSN1 target on vesicles and the presence of a Ras binding domain (RBD) in PI3KC2&#x3B2; suggests a role for Ras in PI3KC2&#x3B2; activation. Here, we demonstrate that nucleotide-free Ras negatively regulates PI3KC2&#x3B2; activity. PI3KC2&#x3B2; preferentially interacts <italic>in vivo</italic> with dominant-negative (DN) Ras, which possesses a low affinity for nucleotides. PI3KC2&#x3B2; interaction with DN Ras is disrupted by switch 1 domain mutations in Ras as well as RBD mutations in PI3KC2&#x3B2;. Using purified proteins, we demonstrate that the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD directly binds nucleotide-free Ras <italic>in vitro</italic> and that this interaction is not disrupted by nucleotide addition. Finally, nucleotide-free Ras but not GTP-loaded Ras inhibits PI3KC2&#x3B2; lipid kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our findings indicate that PI3KC2&#x3B2; interacts with and is regulated by nucleotide-free Ras. These data suggest a novel role for nucleotide-free Ras in cell signaling in which PI3KC2&#x3B2; stabilizes nucleotide-free Ras and that interaction of Ras and PI3KC2&#x3B2; mutually inhibit one another.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Ras is a monomeric G-protein that cycles between GDP- and GTP-bound states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Karnoub1">[1]</xref>. The nucleotide state of Ras is tightly regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> by two classes of proteins: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). GEFs facilitate the release of bound nucleotide from Ras to produce nucleotide-free Ras which preferentially binds GTP due to the higher cellular concentrations of GTP over GDP thereby leading to Ras activation. In contrast, GAPs enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras to facilitate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP resulting in Ras inactivation. Mutations in the Ras genes (H-, K-, and N-Ras) are found in approximately 30% of human tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Karnoub1">[1]</xref>. These mutations typically impair the GTPase activity leading to elevated RasGTP levels and aberrant cell growth due to the chronic engagement of Ras effectors.</p>
      <p>RasGTP has been considered to be the only biologically active form of Ras, although accumulating evidence lends support to the contrary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Diaz1">[5]</xref>. Over-expression of wild-type Ras, which is thought to be predominantly GDP-bound due to its intrinsic GTPase activity, exerts a suppressive effect on oncogenic transformation by constitutively activated Ras alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Diaz1">[5]</xref>. In a chemical carcinogenesis model for lung tumorigenesis, mice hemizygous for K-Ras deletion develop 4&#x2013;5 times more lung tumors than wild-type mice suggesting that the wild-type allele plays a protective role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Zhang1">[2]</xref>. A number of human tumors exhibit loss of heterozygosity of K-Ras further supporting the notion that wild-type Ras functions as a tumor suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Takeuchi1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-DeGregorio1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Kibel1">[8]</xref>. However, these studies do not distinguish whether the suppressive effect of wild-type Ras is due to higher levels of RasGDP or potentially nucleotide-free Ras. Indeed, a similar oncosuppressive effect is seen with dominant-negative Ras, Ras17N, which exerts its inhibitory effect by competing for GEFs due to its low affinity for nucleotides (compared to wild-type Ras) and therefore longer lifetime in the nucleotide-free state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Feig1">[9]</xref>. However, the oncosuppressive effect of Ras17N on Ras-mediated transformation is independent of its interaction with exchange factors suggesting a potential role for nucleotide-free Ras in cellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Feig2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Quilliam1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Stewart1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The above findings lead to the question of whether Ras proteins play a role in signaling independent of nucleotide binding. Indeed, our studies on intersectin1 (ITSN1) provide and example of such a role. ITSNs are multi-domain scaffolding proteins that regulate multiple biochemical pathways in addition to playing a central role in endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-OBryan1">[13]</xref>. There are two ITSN genes, ITSN1 and ITSN2, each coding for a short (S) and long (L) isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Guipponi1">[14]</xref>. The short isoform contains two Eps15 homology (EH) domains, followed by a coiled-coiled (CC) domain, and five Src homology 3 (SH3) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Guipponi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Yamabhai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Sengar1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Okamoto1">[17]</xref>. The longer isoform contains an additional Dbl homology (DH) domain, pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and C2 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Hussain1">[18]</xref>. ITSN1 was initially discovered as a regulator of endocytosis, but recent studies have uncovered a role for this adaptor in intracellular signaling pathways including kinase activation, receptor tyrosine kinase regulation, and compartmentalized-specific Ras activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Yamabhai1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Chabu1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-He1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Martin1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Das1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Adams1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Mohney1">[24]</xref>. We previously reported that ITSN1-S stimulates H-Ras (hereafter referred to as Ras) activation on intracellular vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Mohney1">[24]</xref>. However, the target of this ITSN1-Ras pathway was unclear. The role of ITSN1 in Ras and PI3KC2&#x3B2; regulation combined with the presence of a putative RBD on PI3KC2&#x3B2; lead to the hypothesis that Ras is involved in ITSN1 regulation of PI3KC2&#x3B2; activation. Indeed, our results reveal a unique role for nucleotide-free Ras in negatively regulating PI3KC2&#x3B2; activity suggesting a potential broader role for this form of Ras than previously recognized.</p>

Note: the differences in signal strength of the BiFC signal in (a) vs (b) are due to a lower power setting for the laser in (b) so that pixel intensities can be accurately quantified and are not saturated. In (a) a higher laser power was used to illustrate the punctate localization of the Ras-PI3KC2&#x3B2; complex throughout the cell. (B) Ras interaction with PI3KC2&#x3B2; is disrupted by deletion of the RBD (&#x394;RBD) but not by mutation of the Pro-rich, ITSN1 binding sites (PRD-PA).

CFP-PI3K was cut with XhoI, blunt ended with Klenow, digested with KpnI, and then cloned into the pHA-VC155N vector that had been cut with EcoRI, blunted ended with Klenow, and then digested with KpnI. All Ras constructs used in this manuscript were to the H-Ras isoform and are subsequently referred to only as Ras. pBABE-Ras constructs were a gift from Dr. Lawrence Quilliam (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN). All Ras mutants were PCR amplified using the following primers, 5&#x2032;CACCCGGGATCCTCAGGAGAGCACACAC3&#x2032; and 5&#x2032;TGAGGATCCATG <named-content content-type="gene">ACGGAATATAAG</named-content> 3&#x2032; digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of pFlag-VN-173N.

The Raf-RBD was then cloned into the EcoRV and BamHI sites of the pEFG vector. The RBD of PI3KC2&#x3B2; (aa 364&#x2013;466) was PCR amplified from full-length PI3KC2&#x3B2; using the following primers: 5&#x2032; <named-content content-type="gene">CGCAGATCTGCTGTCACCCCTAGC</named-content> 3&#x2032;, and 5&#x2032; <named-content content-type="gene">CGCCCCGGGAACCTTCT GCTCCATCAGC</named-content> 3&#x2032; digested with BglII and SmaI and then subcloned into YFP digested with BglII/SmaI.

            <title>Model for ITSN1-Ras-PI3KC2&#x3B2; pathway.</title>
            <p>Growth factor stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases leads to the recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex resulting in dissociation of GDP from Ras. We propose that PI3KC2&#x3B2; competes for binding this transient nucleotide-free (nf) Ras trapping it in the nucleotide-free state and preventing GTP loading. In addition, binding of nucleotide-free Ras to PI3KC2&#x3B2; inhibits its lipid kinase activity. The PI3KC2&#x3B2;-Ras complex may then translocate to distal sites such as early endosomes (EE) where ITSN1 then binds to PI3KC2&#x3B2; leading to the release of nucleotide-free Ras and activation of the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2&#x3B2;. In addition, once released from the ITSN1-PI3KC2&#x3B2; complex, Ras binds GTP resulting in Ras activation and recruitment of effectors, e.g., Raf, Class I PI3Ks, etc. Although the above model describes a potential role for nf-Ras in ITSN1 and PI3KC2&#x3B2; function, we propose that nf-Ras may be regulated by additional proteins besides these molecules. Our findings also raise the possibility that the nucleotide-free forms of other GTPases may play a similar role in cell signaling.</p>

        <title>The PI3KC2&#x3B2; RBD directly interacts with nucleotide-free Ras</title>
        <p>While Ras17N is reported to bind GDP in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Stewart1">[12]</xref>, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies indicate that Ras17N binds nucleotides with a &#x223C;30-fold reduced affinity compared to wild-type Ras suggesting that it exists in the nucleotide-free state for extended periods <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Feig1">[9]</xref>. Thus, the interaction between PI3KC2&#x3B2; and Ras17N raises the possibility that the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD interacts with either RasGDP or nucleotide-free Ras. To determine the nucleotide dependence for Ras-PI3KC2&#x3B2; binding, we examined the interaction of Ras and PI3KC2&#x3B2; <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified proteins. Bacterially expressed and purified Ras (aa 1&#x2013;166) was loaded with nucleotide (GDP or GTP&#x3B3;S) and tested for interaction with GST, GST-Raf-RBD (aa 1&#x2013;148), or GST-PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD (aa 368&#x2013;463). As expected, GST-Raf-RBD bound preferentially to RasGTP&#x3B3;S <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Vojtek1">[30]</xref>. In contrast, neither GST-PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD or GST interacted with nucleotide-bound Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), consistent with prior findings from Waterfield and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Arcaro1">[26]</xref>. To determine if the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD interacts with nucleotide-free Ras, we generated nucleotide-free Ras <italic>in vitro</italic> (see Materials and Methods). GST-PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD directly bound nucleotide-free Ras, while little binding was observed between GST-Raf-RBD or GST alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). Addition of nucleotide (either GDP or GTP&#x3B3;S) to the binding reaction prior to incubation at 30&#xB0;C inhibited interaction of Ras and GST-PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD. Addition of GTP&#x3B3;S to the GST-Raf-RBD binding reaction, however, induced Ras-Raf interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). These results indicate that under these experimental conditions, nucleotide-free Ras is generated and in the presence of nucleotide, Ras becomes nucleotide loaded. Next, we examined whether nucleotide could compete off Ras once bound to the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD, a function previously observed with the Ras GEF, CDC25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Lai1">[31]</xref>. Addition of 1 mM nucleotide, either GTP or GDP, was not sufficient to disrupt the complex of Ras-PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). These results suggest that PI3KC2&#x3B2; directly interacts with nucleotide-free Ras, conceivably stabilizing this nucleotide-free intermediate.</p>

        <p>Effectors of activated Ras bind the switch 1 region of Ras (aa 25&#x2013;45), also termed the effector domain. Point mutations (Thr35Ser, Glu37Gly, and Tyr40Cys) in this region of activated Ras (Ras12V) differentially disrupt the interaction with specific effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-White1">[32]</xref>. We examined whether these mutations in the context of Ras17N/69N disrupted binding to PI3KC2&#x3B2;. Ras17N/69N was chosen over Ras17N to avoid any potential complications from Ras interaction with exchange factors. Mutation of Thr35 and Glu37 of Ras17N/69N decreased PI3KC2&#x3B2; binding whereas Tyr40 mutation had no appreciable effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g007">Fig. 7B&#x2013;D</xref>). These mutations in the context of activated Ras (Ras12V) have a similar effect on interaction with Class I PI3Ks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-White1">[32]</xref> suggesting that PI3KC2&#x3B2; interacts with the same region of Ras as Class I PI3Ks but only when Ras is nucleotide-free. Conversely, specific mutations in the RBD of Class I PI3Ks (Thr208 of PI3K-C1&#x3B1;) block Ras binding both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Gupta1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Pacold1">[34]</xref>. Although the RBD of PI3KC2&#x3B2; shares only 18% identity with PI3K-C1&#x3B1; &#x394;RBD, mutation of the analogous Thr in PI3KC2&#x3B2; to Asp (Thr392 to Asp) resulted in a significant decrease in Ras binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>). Furthermore, based on homology modeling of the PI3KC2&#x3B2; RBD onto the structure of the PI3K-C1&#x3B3; RBD, Lys379 of the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD may also influence interaction with Ras. Indeed, mutation of Lys379 to Ala in the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD resulted in significant impairment in Ras binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g007">Fig. 7E</xref>). These results indicate that the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD utilizes a similar molecular surface as Class 1 PI3K RBD in the recognition of the switch 1 region of Ras. However, PI3KC2&#x3B2; binding is specific to nucleotide-free Ras and must be mediated by distinct structural differences.</p>

        <p>Our results predict that the RBD of Raf, but not PI3KC2&#x3B2;, would block Ras-dependent signaling.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Ras, like all GTPases, cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. The transition from the inactive to active state requires formation of nucleotide-free Ras through the action of exchange factors. This state is considered to be a short-lived transition state intermediate <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Bourne1">[36]</xref> based on the relatively high GTP: GDP ratio <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Proud1">[37]</xref>, the ability of GTP to dissociate the GEF-Ras complex <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Lai1">[31]</xref>, and the assumption that there are no proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> that might stabilize nucleotide-free Ras and prevent GTP loading. However, our results provide the first direct evidence for a protein that may stabilize nucleotide-free Ras <italic>in vivo</italic>. We demonstrate that the RBD of PI3KC2&#x3B2; binds nucleotide-free Ras <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In contrast to the GEF-Ras complex, which is disrupted by addition of guanine nucleotides, the PI3KC2&#x3B2; RBD-Ras complex is stable even in the presence of high concentrations of GTP or GDP. These data suggest that PI3KC2&#x3B2; binding to nucleotide-free Ras <italic>in vivo</italic> may prevent loading of nucleotides onto Ras. Although current methods do not allow for detection of nucleotide-free GTPases <italic>in vivo</italic>, our BiFC results provide additional support for our model. PI3KC2&#x3B2; preferentially interacts with Ras17N, which has a 30-fold lower affinity for nucleotide compared to wild type Ras and therefore should exist for longer periods in the nucleotide-free state. As a result, BiFC traps this form of Ras resulting in greater fluorescence complementation for Ras17N (and Ras17N/69N) compared to wild type or constitutively activated Ras (61L or 12V).</p>
      <p>Our findings also reveal a biochemical role for nucleotide-free Ras in regulating cell signaling. Addition of nucleotide-free Ras to PI3KC2&#x3B2; inhibited its <italic>in vitro</italic> lipid kinase activity compared to addition of RasGTP&#x3B3;S. This result is consistent with our observations that ITSN1 activation of AKT is blocked by expression of Ras17N and Ras17N/69N, which is impaired in GEF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g002">Fig. 2</xref>), and dependent on PI3K activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Das1">[22]</xref>. Thus, PI3KC2&#x3B2; represents the first identified biochemical target of nucleotide-free Ras. Our results challenge the long held assumption that nucleotide-free Ras is a short-lived intermediate <italic>in vivo</italic> in the generation of RasGTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Bourne1">[36]</xref>. However, proof of the presence of nucleotide-free Ras bound to PI3KC2&#x3B2;, or potentially other targets, <italic>in vivo</italic> still awaits formal demonstration.</p>
      <p>Based on these observations, we propose that once nucleotide-free Ras is generated through GEF-stimulated nucleotide release, PI3KC2&#x3B2; binding, perhaps in conjunction with additional factors, displaces the GEF and stabilizes nucleotide-free Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). This interaction has two potential consequences: inhibition of GTP loading on Ras bound to PI3KC2&#x3B2; and inhibition of PI3KC2&#x3B2; activity. Such a mechanism might allow for the transport of nucleotide-free Ras to distal cellular compartments where PI3KC2&#x3B2; dissociates from Ras upon some trigger, e.g., ITSN1 binding to PI3KC2&#x3B2;. The dissociation of nucleotide-free Ras from PI3KC2&#x3B2; would then lead to immediate GTP loading, i.e., Ras activation, as well as derepression of PI3KC2&#x3B2;. Indeed, the PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD-Ras complex is refractory to dissociation by high nucleotide concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>) suggesting that additional factors are necessary for this dissociation. Since ITSN1 activates both Ras and PI3KC2&#x3B2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Das1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Mohney1">[24]</xref>, we propose that ITSN1 represents one such factor. Furthermore, RasGTP could then couple to specific Ras effectors at these sites leading to compartmentalized activation of these targets. While there are clear examples for compartmentalized activation of Ras at intracellular sites by specific GEFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Mor1">[38]</xref>, our model suggests a GEF-independent activation of Ras at such intracellular sites. Such a mechanism would decouple GEF localization from GTPase activation while allowing for integration of multiple signaling pathways.</p>
      <p>Our results also suggest an added level of complexity to Ras signaling and transformation. Most efforts at understanding Ras-mediated transformation have centered on identifying those targets that bind RasGTP. However, our data raise the possibility that there is a class of proteins, such as PI3KC2&#x3B2;, that bind nucleotide-free Ras and are negatively regulated by this interaction. Indeed, wild type Ras antagonized Ras-mediated transformation, consistent with this possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Zhang1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Spandidos2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Diaz1">[5]</xref>. Oncogenic activation of Ras would lead to loss of this negative regulation resulting in activation of these targets. Such targets may contribute to Ras-induced transformation without binding activated Ras. Indeed, we have recently implicated PI3KC2&#x3B2; in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Russo1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been long accepted that Class I PI3Ks are effectors of Ras-GTP. However, our data demonstrates for the first time a role for Ras in Class II PI3K regulation. Point mutations in the effector region of Ras that disrupt Class I PI3K binding also disrupt Class II PI3K binding. In addition, concomitant point mutations in the RBDs of Class I and Class II PI3Ks disrupt Ras association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0045360-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Taken together these data suggest that Class I and Class II PI3Ks associate with the same region of Ras, but that this association is mediated by distinct structural differences in the PI3Ks as well as Ras-GTP vs nucleotide-free Ras.</p>
      <p>In addition to PI3Ks, many other proteins have been identified that contain RBDs or Ras-Association (RA) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Ponting1">[40]</xref>. Although, these domains have little sequence homology, they adopt a similar ubiquitin-fold structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Wohlgemuth1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, a group of these domains including Myr5, Tiam-1, Rain, and PLC&#x3B5; do not bind nucleotide-loaded Ras raising the question of whether additional RBDs may share a similar activity in binding nucleotide-free Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Wohlgemuth1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Kalhammer1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-RodriguezViciana1">[43]</xref>. In addition, Class II PI3K alpha (PI3KC2&#x3B1;) also contains an RBD that is 53% similar to PI3KC2&#x3B2;-RBD warranting further investigation into the Ras-binding properties of this PI3K isoform.</p>
      <p>While RasGDP and RasGTP are thought of as the predominant forms of Ras involved in cell signaling, our findings raise the possibility that nucleotide-free Ras may also function in regulating cellular signaling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that <italic>in vitro</italic>, nucleotide-free Ras binds PI3KC2&#x3B2; and that this complex is refractory to dissociation by guanine nucleotides. Furthermore, nucleotide-free Ras inhibits the lipid kinase activity of PI3KC2&#x3B2; suggesting that nucleotide-free Ras plays a negative regulatory role in signaling. Our findings suggest a novel model for compartmentalized signaling in which PI3KC2&#x3B2; results in the redistribution of nucleotide-free Ras to intracellular vesicles leading to localized Ras activation and engagement of specific Ras effectors resulting compartmentalized activation of these targets. While our studies have been limited to H-Ras, both N- and K-Ras isoforms exhibit compartmentalized signaling activity as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Mor1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Bivona1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0045360-Lu1">[45]</xref> suggesting that the nucleotide-free forms of these Ras isoforms may also play an active role in regulating signaling. Our results raise the further possibility that nf-forms of other Ras-related GTPases may play an unappreciated role in cell signaling. Due to the broad role of Ras in cell growth, development, and oncogenesis, our findings suggest that the role of nucleotide-free Ras in cell signaling warrants further examination.</p>
